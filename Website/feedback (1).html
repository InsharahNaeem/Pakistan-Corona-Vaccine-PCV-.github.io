<h3>What can I do to protect myself and others from COVID-19?</h3>
 <p>The following actions help prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza:<br><br>

1. Wear a face mask.<br>
2. Maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and others.<br>
3. Avoid large gatherings.<br>
4. Socialize outdoors.<br>
5. Avoid close contact with people who are sick.<br>
6. Minimize touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.<br>
7. Stay home when you are sick.<br>
8. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.<br>
9. Clean frequently touched objects and surfaces regularly.<br>
10. Wash your hands often with soap and water.<br>
11. Get vaccinated as soon as you are eligible.<br></p>

<h3>What do I need to know about washing my hands effectively?</h3>
<p>
1. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.<br>
2. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.<br>
3. The CDC's handwashing website has detailed instructions and a video about effective handwashing procedures.</p>

<h3>What is physical distancing and why is it important?</h3>
<p>Physical distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. 
For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce physical distancing at a community level.
</p>

<h3>What types of medications and health supplies should I have on hand for an extended stay at home?</h3>
<p>Try to stock at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions. If your insurance permits 90-day refills, that's even better. 
Make sure you also have over-the-counter medications and other health supplies on hand.<br>
1. Medical and health supplies<br>
2. prescription medications<br>
3. prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood-pressure monitoring equipment<br>
4. fever and pain medicine, such as acetaminophen<br>
5. cough and cold medicines<br>
6. antidiarrheal medication<br>
7. thermometer<br>
8. fluids with electrolytes<br>
9. soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer<br>
10. tissues, toilet paper, disposable diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins<br>
11. garbage bags.<br>


<h3>Who do masks protect: the wearer, others, or both?</h3>
<p>We've known for some time that masks help prevent people from spreading the coronavirus to others.
Based on an analysis of existing information, a new study contends that masks may also protect mask wearers from becoming infected themselves.</P>

<h3>What can I do to keep my immune system strong?</h3>
<p>Your immune system is your body's defense system. When a harmful invader � like a cold or flu virus, or the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 � gets into your body, your immune system mounts an attack.<br>
 Known as an immune response, this attack is a sequence of events that involves various cells and unfolds over time.<br><br>
1. Don't smoke or vape.<br>
2. Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.<br>
3. Take a multivitamin if you suspect that you may not be getting all the nutrients you need through your diet.<br>
4. Exercise regularly.<br>
5. Maintain a healthy weight.<br>
6. Control your stress level.<br>
7. Control your blood pressure.<br>
8. If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation (no more than one to two drinks a day for men, no more than one a day for women).<br>
9. Get enough sleep.<br>
10. Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and trying not to touch your hands to your face, since harmful germs can enter through your eyes, nose, and mouth.
